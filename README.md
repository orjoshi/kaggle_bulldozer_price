# kaggle_bulldozer_price

Bulldozer Price prediction (Random Forest Regressor) â€“ Built a machine learning model to predict the 'SalePrice' of equipments using past data.
3 datasets are given :
  1. Train.csv - for training the model
  2. Valid.csv - for validation
  3. Test.csv - for prediction
  
The evaluation metric is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
The RMSLE value for final model on validation set is - '0.24'

test_pred.csv - contains the final predicted data - 'SalesID' and 'SalePrice'
